Sometimes though, it's more than just standing against the establishment. Sometimes, in order to combat corruption, it\u2019s better to abolish the establishment completely and let anarchy reign.Highly intelligent and deeply philosophical, Lonnie Machin developed a strong ethical and apolitical code. Looking at the world around him, he saw corruption, social oppression and the suffering of everyday people\u2014and saw the government doing nothing about it. Taking a cue from the Dark Knight, Machin studied martial arts and put his engineering abilities and knowledge of computer technology to use to become a vigilante himself: Anarky. Although he thinks of himself as a hero like Batman and believes anarchy would help the people help themselves, Batman views Anarky's methods and actions as childish and violent, and considers Anarky a public threat, plain and simple.Anarky uses his abilities to bring down any corporation or authoritative entity that he feels hurts and oppresses people.

He was succeeded by the brilliant Ted Kord, who had no powers to speak of, but carried on the Blue Beetle legacy with just his wits and his fists, along with a whole lot of gadgets and a sharp sense of humor.The most recent Blue Beetle is Jaime Reyes, a teenager from El Paso, Texas who bonded with Dan Garrett's Scarab. The artifact gave him incredible alien armor which he used to defend his hometown from all manner of metahuman criminals.

Even though people assured him a professional career of fame and fortune was in his future, he decided he couldn\u2019t wait and wagered on his own games. The scandal halted his dreams of professional stardom and ruined his reputation. Taking a job as a security guard in the Metropolis Space Museum, Mike saw another opportunity after studying the early age of superheroes. With future and alien technology stolen from the museum, and a time machine that was on display, he realized he could not only become a superhero himself in a past era where his criminal history was unknown, but he could also make his good deeds profitable.With his robot pal Skeets at his side, Mike time-traveled to the modern age and debuted as Booster Gold. For years now, he\u2019s fought evil alongside different versions of the Justice League and his good pal Ted Kord, the second Blue Beetle.

He has also occasionally worked with Earth\u2019s heroes and the U.S. government to protect the planet or serve what he considers to be a greater good. But despite his occasional heroics, Slade Wilson ultimately defers\u00a0to whatever benefits\u00a0himself, finding loopholes in his own code of honor to justify betrayal and manipulation.For more on Deathstroke's history, visit his page on DCUniverse.com.For more on Deathstroke's history, visit his page on DCUniverse.com.For more on Deathstroke's history, visit his page on DCUniverse.com.visit his page on DCUniverse.com.",

If they\u2019ve been deprived of the good fortune of other worlds, worlds that have been graced by benevolent alien protectors, fortuitous lightning strikes and a powerful undercurrent of magic, Earth-33 has made up for it in dreams.These dreams have taken many forms, but most notable of all may be the visual storytelling medium we call comic books. In it, we\u2019ve dreamed of super men who could fly, billionaires who fight crime and Amazon warriors who wield truth-bringing lassos\u2014heroes who have filled up a whole Multiverse of worlds. So when that Multiverse is in danger, it only makes sense that we dream up one more: Ultra Comics, a super hero who exists on Earth-33 the only way he can, in the form of the very medium that birthed them. Will Ultra Comics be enough to keep the Multiverse from falling? Only time will tell.

Born to a life of wealth and privilege, Oliver Queen took it all for granted until tragedy struck at sea, leaving him alone on a deserted island. There, Queen had to dig deep to find out if he had the inner fortitude to survive. While stranded on this island, Oliver honed his already formidable archery skills into becoming the greatest archer ever known.When he finally returned to civilization, he embarked on a career as an urban vigilante, attempting to rid the streets of his hometown of Seattle, and also Star City, from crime and corruption with nothing but a bow and arrow. Viewed as a pampered playboy by the outside world, Green Arrow cares more about the plight of the poor and the suffering in America perhaps more than any other costumed superhero\u2014a \u201csocial justice warrior\u201d in the truest sense of the word.Although an imperfect man, prone to make mistakes in his personal life probably more than most other costumed crusaders, the Green Arrow is nevertheless one of the greatest heroes in the entire DC Universe.

In truth, Lyla was saved moments before her demise by a powerful being known as the Monitor. Locked in eternal struggle for the fate of reality with his antimatter counterpart, the Anti-Monitor, the Monitor had chosen Lyla to act as his personal agent in observing, testing and preparing the world\u2019s greatest heroes and villains for the day their battle spilled over into their universe. To accomplish this important task, the Monitor granted Lyla the powers of strength, flight, regeneration and, most importantly, duplication, allowing her to occupy multiple points at once in order to better prepare the earth for combat in the limited time before the Crisis on Infinite Earths and announce the event\u2019s coming. In this capacity, Lyla Michaels assumed the identity of the Harbinger for her grave but essential duty to announce the doom of the world should its defenders fail to defeat the Anti-Monitor.But unwittingly, Harbinger proved just as effective as an agent of the Anti-Monitor himself. When the Crisis arrived, the Anti-Monitor managed to corrupt Harbinger, leading her to betray the Monitor and bring about his death by her own hands.

Over time, Hank accepted Dawn as a fitting successor to his brother.Dawn\u2019s level head, along with her willingness to see reason and compromise, make her the perfect counterpoint to Hank\u2019s hair-trigger rage and stubbornness.

She, along with several women, who were also reincarnated souls whose lives were cut short by man's hatred, formed the noble Amazon tribe in ancient times. The jealous war god Ares influenced the demigod Heracles into seducing Hippolyta, and then enslaving her after he'd gained her trust. Freed by the goddess Athena, Hippolyta liberated her Amazon sisters and defeated Heracles' soldiers. As atonement for being deceived, she and her sisters were exiled to the island of Themyscira, where they would remain isolated from mankind and immortal as long as they remained there.Eventually, Hippolyta was gifted with a daughter, whom she named Diana. Blessed with powers from the gods themselves, it is unclear if Diana was created when Hippolyta crafted a child made of clay which was gifted with life, or if Diana was born from an affair between herself and Zeus, as there are conflicting accounts to Diana\u2019s creation. Reluctantly, Queen Hippolyta allowed her daughter Diana to leave Themyscira and become Wonder Woman, a fact which has caused her constant worry.

In 1839, an extraterrestrial starship travelling near Earth malfunctioned and exploded, but not before one of its passengers found his way onto a life pod, which then crashed in the middle of a cotton field in the American South. As a failsafe, the pod automatically altered the appearance of its inhabitant, named Arnus, to mimic the first sentient life-form he had contact with, who happened to be a slave woman named Miriam. She adopted the young Arnus as her son and he changed his name to Augustus Freeman.Although Arnus had powers nearly identical to those of Superman, he chose to hide his abilities and live as a normal man, only occasionally using his powers in secret to help others. Barely aging over a century, \"Augustus Freeman\" would change his identity every few decades, posing as his own son. Now known as Augustus Freeman IV, a \"by-the-book\" lawyer in Dakota City, he used his powers for the first time in decades on a gang of home intruders\u2014an event that was witnessed by a young, idealistic girl named Raquel Ervin. After seeing Augustus in action, she convinced him to become a superhero so he could serve as an \"Icon\" to millions who need inspiration. Raquel eventually became his sidekick, calling herself Rocket. While Icon has been a member of teams like the Shadow Cabinet and even the Justice League, these days he\u2019s back to basics, fighting alongside Rocket for the good of Dakota and the world.",

Displaying a vast array of powers that can give even Superman a run for his money, the Martian Manhunter was a founding member of the Justice League of America, and has been a member of almost every incarnation of the League ever since.

However, despite the brutality and violence inflicted upon him, his will never broke and he never gave up hope. He dreamed of escape. But to escape the unescapable, he would need a miracle\u2014so he became Mister Miracle.In order to stop the destructive and long-waged war between New Genesis and Apokolips, the benevolent Highfather agreed to a gesture of peace: he would exchange sons with Darkseid, effectively condemning his child to the hells of Apokolips. Darkseid turned Scott over to Granny Goodness's \"Orphanage,\" where he was subjected to countless horrors and torture in an effort to destroy the goodness inside him, but Scott refused to surrender his innocence. Never physically powerful, Scott instead began training his mind\u2014mentally distancing himself from the pain and sharpening his reason, logic and problem-solving abilities\u2014turning him into an unparalleled and cunning thinker. When he finally made his escape, he succeeded through brain and not brawn, leaving behind the terror of Apokolips for life on Earth as the super hero Mister Miracle.Mister Miracle shares a close and romantic relationship with his fellow New God Big Barda. The two met on Apokolips and quickly fell in love, despite their contrasting personalities. While Barda loves to fight and relishes battle, Scott is more peaceful and kind and simply wants to fit in and lead a normal life, much to Barda's chagrin. Their contrasting personalities but deep love for one another gives them one of the most unique relationships in the DC Universe.Like all New Gods, Mister Miracle possesses beyond superhuman strength, speed, agility, reflexes, stamina and more. Along with his natural gifts, Mister Miracle carries a number of weapons and advanced Apokoliptian technology, including a Mother Box that can transfer energy, sense danger and life, create force fields, project shock-waves and open boom tubes for travel.

His off-the-scales intelligence coupled with his hard work and determination led to him receiving \u00a0multiple PhDs in various fields, founding one of the world's leading tech firms and becoming an Olympic gold medalist to boot. However, his commitment and drive toward perfection left him aloof and closed off from everyone but his wife. When a tragic car accident took her life, Holt found a new goal: to follow in the footsteps of his humanitarian spouse and dedicate his life to helping others and not just himself.He joined the Justice Society of America and used his vast financial and technological resources to create the T-Sphere\u00a0to aid him in his quest. These flying robot spheres respond to Holt's vocal commands and serve a multitude of functions, from passive uses like holographic projection and communication to weaponized usage through explosives and electrical charges.However, Mr. Terrific's true strength comes from his own personal drive to overcome any obstacle and solve any problem. Unfortunately, this determination can also sometimes lead to him shutting out the rest of the world and other people until the problem is solved.

For Vandal Savage, immortality means achieving power by plotting the downfall of humankind to advance his own self-interests\u2014and that makes him one of the most dangerous beings on Earth.Born before recorded history, Vandal Savage encountered a radioactive meteorite that granted him enhanced speed, strength and agility, increased his intelligence beyond the capabilities of the average human\u2014and gifted him immortality. For 50,000 years, Savage roamed and attempted to rule the Earth, claiming direct involvement in some of history's most notorious moments, from the rise and fall of the Roman Empire to the gruesome murders committed by Jack the Ripper.With the rise of super heroes, Savage found a new challenge, a new obstacle in what he perceived as his rightful place as the ruler of Earth. From the Justice Society of America to the Justice League to many of his fellow super-villains, Savage will face down and eliminate anyone who poses a threat to his supremacy\u2014and has thousands of years of experience and planning to pull it off.Along with his enhanced physical abilities, Savage's intelligence makes him an almost-unparalleled tactician and strategist. Savage's immortality not only grants him the ability to survive just about anything, but also has allowed him to amass incredible wealth, resources, knowledge and experience. Without question, Savage ranks as one of the most dangerous beings on Earth...past, present or future.",

So, when Wonder Woman arrived in man\u2019s world with her gods-given gifts preaching the peace and harmony which had always been denied to Cale, the businesswoman took it as a personal offense.Cale would go on to launch Godwatch, which was founded for the purpose of locating Themyscira.

Phobos and Deimos, the sons of the war god Ares, had exploited Cale into leading this expedition by placing a curse on Isadore, her only daughter, which removed her face and soul from her body. Only upon the liberation of Ares from his prison on Paradise Island could Isadore be restored.Cale exacted vengeance upon her blackmailers by allying with the sorceress Circe, who transformed each of them into her own hounds.
